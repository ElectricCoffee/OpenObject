#OpenObject
###Objective-C for human beings.

OpenObject is an open implementation of Objective-C's base libraries designed to be used platform independently.

Objective-C is a very expressive language, but without the Foundation framework, and by extension Cocoa, it's also very crippled.

That's what this project is all about. Since Objective-C's core language is platform independent, all that's needed is to fill in the gaps.

This project is not intended to be an attempt to mirror what Apple already did, in fact it will be very different, and the end result will probably feel very little like Apple's implementation. But that's the point.

IBM BASIC was different from Apple BASIC, despite fundamentally being the same language, Visual C++.NET is different from Qt C++ in terms of the libraries it implements.

So that's what this is, a different take on Objective-C. A more intuitive take, a take inspired by the current languages so it feels less alienating and more welcoming to new users.
